    "## Creating a Layout Wrapper\n",
    "A wrapper is commonly used to center a layout on the page. The wrapper keeps a layout from looking too wide or too narrow depending on the device or viewport width. \n",
    "#### Video review\n",
    "* Giving the wrapper a width prevents the layout from stretching too wide.\n",
    "* Setting the left and right margins to the value auto centers the wrapper in the browser.\n",
    "* One advantage to using `<body>` as the wrapper is that you don’t have to add an extra `<div>` in your markup to contain your layout.\n",
    "* If you want to give your page a full background color or image, you'll need to apply it to the `<html>` element, and you can't place any elements outside of the `<body>`.\n",
    "* Using a wrapper `<div>` is more appropriate if your site has elements that need to be placed outside the wrapper.\n",

    "* If there is no content, padding, or border area to interrupt two touching margins, the margins collapse to the largest of the two margin values.\n",
    "* You may experience margins collapsing in adjacent elements like paragraphs and divs.\n",
    "* If a div's bottom margin is larger than the top margin of the div below it, the margin area between the divs collapses to the largest of the two margin values.\n",

    "## Centering Page Content and Creating a Full-width Header\n",
    "#### Video review\n",
    "* Depending on your design, you may want the header and footer in your layout to stretch from edge to edge of the browser so the left and right sides won't appear cut off.\n",
    "* This approach makes the layout feel open and less constrained.\n",
    "* One approach is to create a wrapper the main content and an inner wrapper for the content inside the header and footer.\n",
    "* You can leave 'outer' elements like the header and footer at their default 100% width.\n",
    "* It's common to have more than one wrapper on a page and even to have containers inside of containers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Challenge\n",
    "* Add a wrapper `<div>` around the content inside `<body>`. Give it the class 'container'.\n",
    "* Set the wrapper's width to 80% of the browser width. Then use margins to center the wrapper in the browser.\n",

    "## How Floats Work\n",
    "Floats are similar to the inline-block method you learned in the previous section. You can layout elements side by side to create horizontal navigation menus and columns. The biggest difference between floats and inline-block is that floated elements are taken out of the normal document flow and content flows, or wraps, alongside them.\n",

    "#### Video review\n",
    "* By default, browsers display elements in the order they appear in the HTML source code. This order is called the normal document flow.\n",
    "* Elements in the normal document flow are either block or inline; they appear stacked on top of each other or on the same line as the content and elements beside them.\n",
    "* When you apply a float to an element, the element gets taken out of the normal document flow and shifted to the left or right side of its container.\n",
    "* Any content next to the float flows -- or wraps -- around its left or right side.\n",
    "##### Creating Horizontal Naviagtion with Floats Review\n",
    "* With floats, we don't have to worry about the the extra whitespace that can appear when using inline or inline-block display.\n",
    "* Floated elements will sit adjacent to each other regardless of the HTML whitespace between them.\n",
    "* If a block-level element contains floated elements, its height collapses.\n",
